# Complexity-Robotics-PID-line-follower

All my code used to build a white line follower for a robotics competition. Got first place as a high school student competing in the university catogory. 
IF you have any questions about how the code works and want to use it just send me a DM on instagram.

Parts Used:

1. Arduino Uno Controller
2. L298-H Motor Driver Module
3. QTR8RC Line Sensor
4. Profast 1500 Rpm Line Follower Motors x 2
5. SLT20 Silicone Wheels x 2
6. 3D printted Line Follower Body x 1
7. 20 mm Motor Brackets x 2
8. Female-Male Jumper Wires 
9. Wires to connect motors (soldered)
10. Lipo Battery (3S 450 Mah)
11. JST Connector Cable (to connect the lipo battery)
12. Switch (on and off)
